My submission for [Lab
5](http://web2.clarkson.edu/class/cs444/assignments/sync/) for my OS class at
[Clarkson](http://clarkson.edu).

There are three solutions here. One using simple coarse locking (spmc_dumb.c),
one uses smarter locking (spmc_clever.c), and one is lockless
(spmc_lockless.c). The comments in each describe the solution more clearly.
